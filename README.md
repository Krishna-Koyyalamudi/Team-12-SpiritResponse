### Detailed description of text fields, UILables, buttons :

- Buttons: 
    In our proposed project we are using a total of 7 buttons 
- Start button: By clicking this button we can start calculating the reaction time of the  user.

- Stop Button: By clicking this button we can terminate the  process.

- BAC: By clicking this button we can get the breath analyzer data. 

- Calculate: By clicking this button we can calculate how sober a person is.

- Male: If the user is male then he needs to click this button.

- Female: If the user is female then she needs to click this button.

- Reset : By clicking this button we can reset the data.

- UILables:
       In our proposed project we are using around 10 labels to store and get different data will explained briefly as follows
- Reaction time: This label will store the time taken by the user to react.

- Performed at: This label will store the date and time at which the task is performed

- Pictorial Representation: This label is for displaying the graph for all user reaction time logs with x-axis as date and time, y-axis as the reaction time.

- Male: This label is used to store that the user is male

- Female: This label is used to store that the user is female

- Weight: This label will stores the weight of the user 

- No of Drinks taken:  This label will store the user drinks data.

- Time since first drink: This label will store the time of the first drink of the user.

- Result: This label will store the result 

- Stage: This label will store the condition of the user.

- Rate:  This label will store the result that we got in the previous step

- Stage: This label will store the condition of the user.

- Recorded date: This label will records the date of the task performed

Text Fields: 
In our proposed project we are using around 8 text fields to store the

1.	Reaction time of the user
2.	To enter the Recorded date
3.	Stage of the user
4.	To display the Result 
5.	To enter the Weight of the user
6.	No of drinks of the user
7.	To enter the Time since the first drink
8.	Rate of the user

- Explaining  how items in the program will interact with one another.

- The items in the program will interact with one another like based upon the reaction time and performed time period we are going to display the graph for all user reaction time logs with x-axis as date and time, y-axis as the reaction time.And based upon the user weights , number of drinks he/she taken and time of drink their have taken we are going to calculate how sober a person is. Finally we are going to get breath analyzer data from the stage, rate and recorded date of the user.

- Overview of the functions we are gonna use in the project Our application provides different functionalities such as calculating the amount of alcohol consumed by a person from the Breath Analyzer (Internet of Things Device), calculating how quickly a person reacts (Reaction time), a log and graph of the personâ€™s reaction time and a calculator that tells us how sober the person is.

 - Parameters for each function:
 
 This application is for the people who have the habit of alcohol consumption and want to check their BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration) and also for the people who want to check their reaction time
